# My PowerShell Scripts

Welcome to my collection of PowerShell scripts! Here, I'll share some useful scripts to solve common problems.

## Getting Started

1. **Install VS Code:**
   If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code.

2. **Create a New Folder:**
   Open VS Code and create a new folder where you'll store your PowerShell scripts. You can do this by clicking on the Explorer icon (folder icon) in the sidebar and selecting "New Folder."

3. **Create a New Markdown File:**
   Inside your folder, create a new file named `readme.md`. This will serve as your main documentation file.

## Writing PowerShell Scripts

You can write your PowerShell scripts directly in VS Code. Here are some tips:

- Use the `.ps1` extension for your PowerShell script files.
- To create a new script, click on the Explorer icon, right-click in your folder, and choose "New File." Name it something like `myscript.ps1`.
- Write your PowerShell code in the `.ps1` file. You can include comments, variables, functions, and more.
